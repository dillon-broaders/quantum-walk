# Quantum walk

This was a short coding project I did on quantum random walks. The purpose was to exactly reproduce a figure from a papeer titled Multi-bit quantum random number generation from a single qubit quantum walk by Anupam Sarkar et. al. This was originally a Python project but I went back recently and changed it to Julia as a good way to practice the langauge.
